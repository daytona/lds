# Theme
Change color theme of an block. Using the Theme-bg--{{colorValue}} sets the background-color of the block and if necessary changes the default text color of that block.

Using the Theme--{{colorValue}} defines which color to be used for links, bullets and buttons within that block. (at least in theory)
