## Building Assets

```
$ lds build
$ lds build script
$ lds build styles
$ lds build icons
$ lds build images
$ lds build fonts
```
or continous wathing for file change using:
```
$ lds watch
```
When in watch mode, the API will also fire a reload event to all connected clients, reloading them whenever new content is available, making testing on multiple devices a charm.
